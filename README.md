Requirements
 Anaconda OR Miniconda
Tip

If you have trouble deciding between Anaconda and Miniconda, please refer to the table below

Anaconda	Miniconda
New to conda and/or Python	Familiar with conda and/or Python
Not familiar with using terminal and prefer GUI	Comfortable using terminal
Like the convenience of having Python and 1,500+ scientific packages automatically installed at once	Want fast access to Python and the conda commands and plan to sort out the other programs later
Have the time and space (a few minutes and 3 GB)	Don't have the time or space to install 1,500+ packages
Don't want to individually install each package	Don't mind individually installing each package
Typing out entire Conda commands can sometimes be tedious, so I wrote a shell script (conda_shortcuts.sh on GitHub Gist) to define shortcuts for commonly used Conda commands.

Example: Delete/remove a conda environment named test_env
Installation
Verify that conda is installed
conda --version
Ensure conda is up to date
conda update conda
Enter the directory where you want the repository (grovers-algorithm) to be cloned
POSIX
cd ~/path/to/directory
Windows
cd C:\Users\user\path\to\directory
Clone the repository (grovers-algorithm), then enter (i.e. cd command) grovers-algorithm directory
git clone https://github.com/lynkos/grovers-algorithm.git && cd grovers-algorithm
Create a conda virtual environment from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
Activate the virtual environment (grovenv)
conda activate grovenv
Confirm that the virtual environment (grovenv) is active
If active, the virtual environment's name should be in parentheses () or brackets [] before your command prompt, e.g.
(grovenv) $
If necessary, see which environments are available and/or currently active (active environment denoted with asterisk (*))
conda info --envs
OR
conda env list
Usage
Tip

If you're unsure about which subsection(s) to follow, please refer to the table below

Visual Studio Code	Command Line
Beginner/User-friendly	Recommended if familiar with using terminals/shells/CLIs
GUI	CLI
Click a button to run program	Execute a command in terminal/shell/CLI to run program
Python Script
Note

Although they both perform the same function, there's a discernable difference between grovers_algorithm.py and grovers_algorithm.ipynb. The former is a Python script, the latter is a Jupyter notebook.

Command Line (Recommended)
Run grovers_algorithm.py

python src/grovers_algorithm.py
Command Line Arguments
Option	Type	Description	Default
-H, --help		Show help message and exit	
-T, --title <title>	str	Window title	"Grover's Algorithm"
-n, --n-qubits <n_qubits>	int	Number of qubits	5
-s, --search <search>	int	Nonnegative integers to search for	11 9 0 3
(i.e., { 11, 9, 0, 3 })
-S, --shots <shots>	int	Number of simulations	1000
-f, --font-size <font_size>	int	Histogram's font size	10
-p, --print	bool	Whether or not to print quantum circuit(s)	False
-c, --combine	bool	Whether to combine all non-winning states into 1 bar labeled "Others" or not	False
Visual Studio Code
Open grovers_algorithm.py
Run grovers_algorithm.py: Click ▷ (i.e. Play button) in the upper-right corner
Jupyter Notebook
Visual Studio Code (Recommended)
Open the Command Palette with the relevant keyboard shortcut
Mac
⌘ + Shift + P
Windows
CTRL + Shift + P
Search and select Python: Select Interpreter
Select the virtual environment (grovenv)
Open grovers_algorithm.ipynb
Confirm grovenv is the selected kernel
Run grovers_algorithm.ipynb by clicking Run All
Command Line
Install ipykernel in the virtual environment (grovenv)
conda install -n grovenv ipykernel
Add the virtual environment (grovenv) as a Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=grovenv
Open grovers_algorithm.ipynb in the currently running notebook server, starting one if necessary
jupyter notebook src/grovers_algorithm.ipynb
Select the virtual environment (grovenv) as the kernel before running grovers_algorithm.ipynb
Cleanup
[Optional] Deactivate the virtual environment (grovenv) to clean up and remove it
conda deactivate
Close the terminal
Examples
These serve as example outputs/results of the running Grover's algorithm (i.e. files in src)
